[SITENAME] - Order ID Correction Request
Hello [NAME],

Thank you for your recent attempt to register on [SITENAME].

However, [NXTLVLFIELD], is not valid for registration. Please, provide us with a valid Order ID. 
For registration on the [SITENAME] you need the ID of the Network Migration Workbook Order.

This ID is located in the Purchase Receipt Email you received after you purchased the book.  It consists of 9 digits.
If you ordered through Amazon the ID will be slightly different.

Please logon to the Website and enter the correct Order ID by editing your User Profile:

Once logged in click the "User Profile" in the top menu. 
Then on the "Edit" tab click the "Update Your Profile" item.
Towards the bottom you'll see "Network Migration Workbook Order ID:", enter the new Order ID here.

Once you enter in the new ID we will verify it within 72 hours.

If you can't find the receipt and need assistance, please contact us : sales@DomainNameHere.com . 

Thank you,
[SITENAME] Team
