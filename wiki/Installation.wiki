#summary Installation Readme.

= Introduction =
<p>This readme assumes you have a Joomla 1.5.x and Community Builder 1.2.x installation already setup. It also assumes you're familiar with editing PHP files. If you're shakey on the latter this process might not be best for you.</p>
<p>This ZIP file contains all the files necessary to setup Community Builder to use a secondary confirmation process to upgrade a user's access level based on a value stored in a CB data field. I personally used it to confirm Purchase ID's for a book.</p>
<p>The plugin uses an email message which is sent to a third party, presumably an Administrator in Joomla. This user then verifies the value submitted and clicks one of the supplied links to confirm or deny the access upgrade.</p>

= Details =
<p>Here's the scenario I wanted to solve:
<ul>
<li>User clicks Login/Register Here button for Community Builder</li>
<li>Registration form displayed with extra NxtLvlWatchField</li>
<li>User fills out form including NxtLvlWatchField value</li> 
<li>User submits form</li> 
<li>Normal CB User email confirmation sent</li> 
<li>User clicks email confirmation link</li> 
<li>CB onAfterUserConfirm Event triggers NxtLvlConfirm plugin to email "NxtLvlEmailToUser" to confirm NxtLvlWatchField value, if entered</li> 
<li>"NxtLvlEmailToUser" clicks confirmation link which triggers NxtLvlConfirm which upgrades User Access level to NxtLvlOnConfirmedGroup</li>
<li>User able to view/download NxtLvlOnConfirmedGroup content</li> 
</ul>
</p>
<p>The process to get this plugin up and running is:
<ol>
<li>Download and install the plugin via the CB Plugin Manager</li>
<li>Add the appropriate fields via the CB Field Manager, one must be named nxtlvlactivation, the other is configurable in the next step</li>
<li>Once the install completes successfully, click the Next Level Confirmation plugin link in the CB Plugin Manager list and configure/enable.</li>
<li>Hack the com_profiler.php core file for CB.</li>
</ol>
</p>
