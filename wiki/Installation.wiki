#summary Installation Readme.

= Introduction =
<p>This readme assumes you have a Joomla 1.5.x and Community Builder 1.2.x installation already setup. It also assumes you're familiar with editing PHP files. If you're shakey on the latter this process might not be best for you.</p>
<p>This ZIP file contains all the files necessary to setup Community Builder to use a secondary confirmation process to upgrade a user's access level based on a value stored in a CB data field. I personally used it to confirm Purchase ID's for a book.</p>
<p>The plugin uses an email message which is sent to a third party, presumably an Administrator in Joomla. This user then verifies the value submitted and clicks one of the supplied links to confirm or deny the access upgrade.</p>
